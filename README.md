Papyrus is a flat file CMS, utilizing Markdown files and heavy use of file compilation and performance optimizations to provide a fast website that is easy to administrate. It's meant to provide simple publishing without requiring knowledge of static website compilers and avoiding their limitations, and is therefore a server side application that does all compilation on-demand. *Every choice has been made with the developer in mind.*

It's built using the [SOMA framework](https://github.com/soma-php/soma/) and provides a very extensible and modular base for you to create custom features and simple but effective logic for routing and theming.
